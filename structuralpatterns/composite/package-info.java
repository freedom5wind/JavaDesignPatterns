/**
 * Intent
 * <p>
 * Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
 * Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The key to Composite pattern is an abstract class that represents <i>both</i> primitives and their containers.
